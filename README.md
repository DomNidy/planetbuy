# Planetbuy

 [**Planetbuy**](https://planetbuy.vercel.app/) is a full-stack app developed within the NextJS framework. It designed to implement functionality similar to real-estate platforms like [*airbnb*](https://www.airbnb.com/). However, as the same suggests; on Planetbuy you are "buying planets" *(fictional planets, with fictional currency)*. This app is entirely for **learning purposes**.
