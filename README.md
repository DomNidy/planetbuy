# Planetbuy

 [**Planetbuy**](https://planetbuy.vercel.app/) is a full-stack app developed within the NextJS framework. It designed to implement functionality similar to real-estate platforms like [*airbnb*](https://www.airbnb.com/). However, as the same suggests; on Planetbuy you are "buying planets" *(fictional planets, with fictional currency)*. This app is entirely for **learning purposes**.

  

## Features
The table below contains the features Planetbuy plans to implement, and the status of their implementation. 

| Feature | Status |
|--|--|
| Create an account |✔️|
| Create a guest account |✔️|
| Purchase a planet |✔️|
| Advanced querying & filtering for planet listings |✔️|
| Re-list purchased planets on the marketplace |🚧|
| View prior transaction history |🚧|

- ✔️ indicates a feature has been fully implemented.
- ❌ indicates implementation of a feature has not yet begun.
- 🚧 indicates a feature is in the process of being implemented.

## Todo:
- Show a toast indicating an error when a user attempts to add an item they own to their cart
- Design icons indicating planet quality, these can be displayed on PlanetCards on the main index page when the screen width is low (provides clearance for other UI elements)
- Clean up styling & css, there are some elements with arbitrary placeholder styles
